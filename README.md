# 👋 Hi, I’m Shashank

I am a **final-year engineering student** who enjoys building, experimenting with, and improving **real-world software systems**. My interests span across **full-stack development, machine learning, computer vision, and cloud platforms**, with a strong curiosity about how software behaves in real environments and under real constraints.

Rather than limiting myself to a single domain, I work on **end-to-end projects**—from problem understanding and system design to implementation, testing, and deployment. I enjoy breaking complex ideas into **practical, working solutions** and continuously refining them through iteration.

## 📌 How I Use GitHub

- I treat GitHub as a **learning log**, not just a code dump  
- I push **incremental improvements**, not only final versions  
- I experiment with **refactors, optimizations, and new ideas**  
- I document systems so others can **understand, run, and extend them**
