# 👋 Hello, I'm Shashank

> *Final-year engineering student exploring how software systems behave in the real world.*

I enjoy **building, experimenting, breaking, and improving software systems** that go beyond simple demos. My interests lie at the intersection of **full-stack development, machine learning, computer vision, and cloud platforms**, where systems must be reliable, secure, and adaptable.

Instead of limiting myself to one domain, I focus on **end-to-end problem solving**—from understanding the problem and designing the system to implementing, testing, and refining it through real usage and feedback.

## 🧭 My Approach to Building Software

I believe good software is not just about features—it is about **decisions, trade-offs, and behavior over time**.

- I start with **problem understanding**, not tools  
- I design **complete system flows**, not isolated components  
- I combine **ML logic with backend safeguards**
- I focus on **security, reliability, and explainability**
- I learn by **iterating, refactoring, and improving**
